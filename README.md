Smart Task Analyzer

Smart Task Analyzer is a Django-based mini-application designed to help users intelligently prioritize and manage tasks. It calculates a priority score for each task based on multiple factors including urgency, importance, effort, and dependencies, allowing users to quickly identify what they should work on first. This project was completed as part of the technical assessment for the Software Development Intern position at NxtWave/Singularium Technologies.

The application allows users to add tasks individually through a form or in bulk using a JSON array. Each task is scored using the TaskScorer algorithm, which considers urgency by checking due dates and giving extra weight to past-due or soon-due tasks, importance by using a user-provided rating from 1 to 10, effort by giving a bonus for low-effort tasks, and dependencies by prioritizing tasks that block others. Users can select different sorting strategies including "Smart Balance" (default, which balances all factors), "Fastest Wins" (low-effort first), "High Impact" (importance first), and "Deadline Driven" (due date first). The top three tasks are also suggested for the current day with a short explanation for why they were chosen.

The project uses Python 3.8+ with Django 4.0+, and the frontend is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. The backend uses SQLite as the database, which requires no additional setup. The frontend communicates with the Django backend via API endpoints that handle JSON data. Special attention was given to handling edge cases such as missing fields, invalid dates, and past-due tasks, ensuring the application works smoothly with real-world data.

The development process included setting up the Django project and app, creating the task model, implementing the TaskScorer algorithm, developing API views for analyzing and suggesting tasks, and building a responsive frontend interface with real-time results display. The code emphasizes clean structure, meaningful variable names, proper error handling, and maintainability. The scoring algorithm is configurable through different strategies, giving the user flexibility in prioritization.

During development, design decisions focused on simplicity and usability. The frontend is served through Django to avoid CORS issues, and CSRF protection is exempted for API testing convenience. JSON input allows for bulk task submissions, and task cards are color-coded based on priority for visual clarity. Testing was performed to ensure tasks are scored correctly, sorted accurately, and that invalid inputs do not crash the system.

The total time spent on this assignment was approximately five hours, distributed across backend setup, algorithm development, API and URL routing, frontend creation, and debugging. With more time, the project could be enhanced by detecting circular dependencies, accounting for weekends and holidays in urgency calculation, adding an Eisenhower Matrix visualization, implementing a learning system for algorithm feedback, and expanding unit tests to cover frontend interactions.

This project demonstrates a combination of algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, clean coding practices, and practical frontend-backend integration in Python and Django. It is intended to showcase the ability to translate requirements into a functional application with clear documentation and maintainable code.
